# What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting information from a readable format (plaintext) into an encoded version (ciphertext) that can only be decoded by authorized parties. It's one of the most important concepts in information security and has a history dating back thousands of years.

## Why Encryption Matters

In today's digital world, encryption serves several critical purposes:

- **Privacy**: Protecting sensitive personal and business information
- **Security**: Preventing unauthorized access to data
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of message senders
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data hasn't been altered during transmission

## A Brief History of Encryption

Encryption has evolved dramatically from ancient ciphers to modern cryptographic algorithms:

| Era | Key Developments |
|-----|-----------------|
| Ancient | Simple substitution ciphers (e.g., Caesar cipher) |
| Middle Ages | Polyalphabetic ciphers (e.g., Vigen√®re cipher) |
| WWI & WWII | Mechanical encryption devices (e.g., Enigma machine) |
| 1970s | Development of DES (Data Encryption Standard) |
| 1990s | Adoption of RSA and public-key cryptography |
| 2000s | Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) becomes standard |
| Today | Quantum-resistant cryptography research |

In this book, we'll explore both historical and modern encryption techniques, starting with fundamental concepts that form the building blocks of today's cryptographic systems.

Let's begin by understanding the difference between encoding and encryption in the next chapter.
